After a quick redesign from my old site and a significant performance boost, my new site is complete and live. 

The site is built using Gatsby, a static-site generator which over the last year or so I have come to enjoy enourmously. Over the next few months I'll be blogging about the various features of Gatsby that make it so useful (there are many), and about all the technologies that I have been experimenting with lately. 

I'll also be talking alot about performance, as it is something that I think is often overlooked but always beneficial. 

Until then, here are a few articles about Gatsby:
