Do you want to build an online shop? Get started building a lightning-fast, secure e-commerce experience that your customers will love.

The benefits of e-commerce are vast and well known; everything from fast, stream-lined shopping experiences for your customers, 24/7 opening times, lower operating costs, additional custom through search engines and, of course, <strong>no queues!</strong> E-commerce can really take your shop to the next level.

I’ve built many e-commerce solutions in the past, and I really enjoy building the shopping experience with the client and watching them grow. There’s something truly exciting about seeing the first customers sign up and the <strong>orders start to pile in</strong>.

The issue with alot of online shops is that they load too slowly: according to [Google research](https://neilpatel.com/blog/speed-is-a-killer/) 53% of mobile users leave a site that takes longer than three seconds to load! That’s almost half of your potential customers abandoning your site due to slow speed and poor performance. Unfortunately most of these sites are built by companies using last decades tech. I combat this issue using cutting-edge technology, and aim to have all my sites respond within 3 seconds.
