First impressions count for so much, particularly when it comes to website speed and performance. The first impression your user will have of your online business is defined by how quickly the site loads, and the implications of this detail are huge:

- <p>79% of online shoppers say they won’t use a website again if it loads too slow</p>
- <p>44% of your website users will tell their friends about a bad online shopping experience</p>
- <p>40% of potential customers will leave your site if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load: if your store has 50,000 visitors per month and takes 4 seconds or longer to load, that’s a loss of 20,000 potential customers, every month</p>

<p>This is poor website performance in a nutshell, and could be seriously damaging your potential sales. A good example is when Amazon performed tests that showed they would

Just ask yourself how many times you’ve abandoned a website because it took too long to load. If your own website is poorly performant then it might not even get a chance to shine; the user will simply give up when it fails to respond in an appropriate time frame. Not only does this mean less traffic to your own business, but it could be driving traffic to your competitors business.

Lastly, website speed and performance is now used as part of the Google page ranking algorithm. Having a poorly performant site will negatively effect where you sit in the Google page rankings.

Put succinctly, poor website performance can seriously damage your business.

### Let's Talk

I’ve long been obsessed with performance and speed when it comes to websites, and I consider optimisation to be an integral part of the development process. I’ve worked for numerous companies where website speed was crucial, and along the way I have gathered a wealth of experience in improving site performance. 

Even the slowest, most under-performant website can be improved upon, and with a series of tweaks you can go from load times of 10 to 3 seconds within a relatively small amount of time. The can seriously add a new lease of life to your website, something that both you and your customers can enjoy.
