Using website development to create custom solutions for businesses is an incredibly effective way to reduce time-consuming, repetitive tasks and increase productivity. Perhaps you have a step in your business workflow that you think could be automated to save time. Perhaps you want to move your pen-and-paper customer records online to a Customer Relationship Management system. Whatever the problem is, a bespoke solution could well be the answer.  

Bespoke solutions are incredibly broad (as broad as the numerous technical problems that they address), however a number of examples of custom development are found below:

- <p>Booking / Events system - events systems can help you to sell tickets to gigs, book classes for gyms or yoga studios etc</p>
- <p>Diary system - these are incredibly helpful if you are a freelance personal trainer, or maybe you offer online tuition of some sort and want to be able to organise your day</p>
- <p>Customer Relationship Management system - strengthen the bond with your customer and harness the power of CRMs to help your company work more efficiently. Your customers will love it</p>
- <p>Content Management System (CMS) - are you looking to start a blog? Maybe you want to keep your customers updated as your business grows? A CMS can be a useful tool to in providing fresh content to your users and keep them coming back</p>
- <p>Marketing Automation - <a href="https://funneloverload.com/marketing-automation-statistics/" target="_blank">75% of all companies</a> use some form of marketing automation to keep their customers in sync with their business. Even a small amount of automation can save a great deal of time (and money), so you can understand why there is such an emphasis on marketing automation</p>
