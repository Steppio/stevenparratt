Need a website for your business? Don't use last decades tech, build a lightning-fast site that really sets your business apart.

Having an online presence for your business or personal project can open you up to a whole new range of potential clientele and opportunities. If you look at the most recent successful startups in your area, odds are that they have a solid online presence - this is just good business, as [88% of consumers will research product information before they make a purchase](https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/importance-of-a-website/). If you don’t have this information available on the internet, chances are that potential customer will find a competitor that does offer that information online.

Websites can help you in a number of ways: they display information about your business to your customers, help new clientele find you through search engines, act as a hub for all of your social media / contact options and keep customers up to date with the latest changes and expansions of your business.

I offer lightning-fast websites that users and search engines just love. Most websites take anywhere between 5 and 15 seconds to load, however according to [Google research](https://neilpatel.com/blog/speed-is-a-killer/) 53% of mobile users leave a site that takes longer than three seconds to load! That’s almost half of your potential customers abandoning your site due to slow speed and poor performance. Unfortunately most of these sites are built by companies using <strong>last decades tech</strong>. I combat this issue using cutting-edge technology, and aim to have all my sites <strong>respond within 3 seconds</strong>.

I’ve worked with a wide range of clients on a huge number of websites, and I’m genuinely excited to hear new business ideas. If you want to get in touch please <a href="#contactSection">Contact Me</a> and we can discuss your new project, and take your project from idea to reality.
