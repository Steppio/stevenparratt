Already have a website but are unhappy with its speed / performance? No problem, Contact Me for an performance assessment for your site or Read More

Perhaps you already have a website, but you are disappointed with its speed and / or performance. This is a common problem as more often than not website agencies will push the product live before any optimisation work has been done. 

Sadly optimisation is more of an after-thought for a lot of companies, as pushing the website live and pushing traffic to it appears to be more of a priority. This makes sense, but slow websites or poor website performance can make users impatient and leave - according to [Google research](https://neilpatel.com/blog/speed-is-a-killer/) 53% of mobile users leave a site that takes longer than three seconds to load! If your site has been pushed live with poor performance, you can say goodbye to half of that potential traffic you’re driving to it.

I’ve long been obsessed with performance and speed when it comes to websites, and I consider optimisation to be an integral part of the development process. If you are having issues with your website performing badly, and are curious as to how much traffic you could be losing, Contact Me and I can give you a fast assessment of your website's current performance.
