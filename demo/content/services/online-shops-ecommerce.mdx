Are you looking to start an online business? Maybe you already own an e-commerce shop and are looking to improve it? It’s a smart move - worldwide online sales are expected to grow to £3 trillion by 2021. E-commerce is expected to make up <a target="_blank" href="https://ecommerceguide.com/ecommerce-statistics/">17.5% of global retail sales by 2021</a>, and that figure only continues to rise. Simply put, there has never been a better time to bring your business online.

The first and most obvious advantage to having an e-commerce store is that you don’t need a brick and mortar shop to sell from. This can drastically reduce the financial overheads usually associated with a shop. In truth this is just the tip of the iceberg, as e-commerce has a great deal of additional advantages: 

- <p>24/7 opening times - why lose sales outside of regular business hours? </p>
- <p>Fast, personalised shopping experience for your customer - keep your patrons happy and they'll keep your business happy</p>
- <p>Sell internationally - open your shop up to international sales and new potential for growth</p>
- <p>Additional sales through search engines - harness the power of web crawlers to drive more traffic to your website</p>
- <p>Combine social media campaigns with e-commerce for vast growth potential</p>
- <p>Understand more of your customers needs and preferences through detailed analytical data</p>
- <p>And everyone's favourite - no queues! </p>

As I explain on my <a href="/services/website-speed-and-performance">website performance</a> page, I like to build my sites with speed and performance in mind. This will <strong>help more customers find you</strong> and <strong>keep those customers coming back</strong>. I have been building e commerce solutions for a long time and thoroughly enjoy every step of the process, however the most exciting and intriguing step for me is when the site goes live and the customers start to come in - through analytics you can see how many people are at your store, where they are from in the world, what products they enjoy etc. When you combine a deep understanding of your customers preferences with excellent website speed and performance, it truly is a recipe for success.
