I’ve worked with dozens of developers in the past but for the last 8 years I’ve enjoyed such a good working relationship with Steven that I now work with him exclusively. He is talented, tenacious, highly creative in his problem solving and perhaps most importantly, utterly reliable. He also has a rare talent for translating technical language into plain English and his coding prowess has attracted high praise from many other IT specialists we’ve partnered with on occasion over the years. The most important benefit to our working relationship is that he goes out of his way to truly immerse himself in the workings of our business and understand the sector at large which makes him very intuitive and allows him to predict what our needs will be and identify potential future problems, often before they’ve even occurred to us! This is EXACTLY what any business should be looking for in an IT partner – I cannot recommend highly enough!
