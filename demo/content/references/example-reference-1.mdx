I’ve worked with dozens of developers in the past but for the last 8 years I’ve enjoyed such a good working relationship with Steven that I now work with him exclusively. He is talented, tenacious, highly creative in his problem solving and perhaps most importantly, utterly reliable. He also has a rare talent for translating technical language into plain English. This is EXACTLY what any business should be looking for in an IT partner – I cannot recommend highly enough!
